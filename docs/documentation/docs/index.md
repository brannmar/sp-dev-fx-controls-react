# Reusable React controls for your SharePoint Framework solutions ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pnp/spfx-controls-react.svg)

This repository provides developers with a set of reusable React controls that can be used in SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions. The project provides controls for building web parts and extensions.

    In order to migrate to `v2` it is advised to follow this guide: [Migrating from V1](./guides/migrate-from-v1).

!!! attention
    The controls project has a minimal dependency on SharePoint Framework version `1.3.0`. Be aware that the controls might not work in solutions your building for SharePoint 2016 with Feature Pack 2 on-premises. As for SharePoint 2016 with Feature Pack 2 version `1.1.0` of the SharePoint framework is the only version that can be used. SharePoint 2019 on-premises uses SharePoint framework `v1.4.0` and therefore should be fine to use with these controls.

## Getting started

### Installation

To get started you have to install the following dependency to your project: `@pnp/spfx-controls-react`.

Enter the following command to install the dependency to your project:

```bash
npm install @pnp/spfx-controls-react --save --save-exact
```

### Configuration

!!! note
    Since `v1.4.0` the localized resource path will automatically be configured during the dependency installation.

Once the package is installed, you will have to configure the resource file of the property controls to be used in your project. You can do this by opening the `config/config.json` and adding the following line to the `localizedResources` property:

```json
"ControlStrings": "node_modules/@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/loc/{locale}.js"
```

## Telemetry

All controls gather telemetry to verify the usage. Only the name of the control and related data gets captured. 

> More information about the service that we are using for this can be found here: [PnP Telemetry Proxy](https://github.com/pnp/telemetry-proxy-node).

Since version `1.17.0` it is possible to opt-out of the telemetry by adding the following code to your web part:

```typescript
import PnPTelemetry from "@pnp/telemetry-js";
...
const telemetry = PnPTelemetry.getInstance();
telemetry.optOut();
```
